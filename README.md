Welcome to OurChatStory.co, a web app that allows you to analyze and gain insights from your WhatsApp chats. With OurChatStory.co, you can easily visualize your chat data using informative graphs and charts.

OurChatStory.co is built using NextJS, a powerful JavaScript framework for building server-rendered applications. NextJS makes it easy to create efficient and scalable web apps, and it allows us to easily integrate with your WhatsApp data.

To get started with OurChatStory.co, you will need to set up some environment variables. These variables will allow the app to connect to your WhatsApp account and retrieve your chat data.

To set up the environment variables, create a file called .env in the root directory of the app. In this file, you will need to specify the following variables:

NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL: The URL of the API server. This is the URL of the server that will be used to retrieve your chat data. 
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENV: The environment that the app is running in. This can be either "staging" or "prod".
Once you have set up the environment variables, you can start the app by running the following command in the terminal:

Copy code
npm run dev
This will start the NextJS development server, and you can access the app at http://localhost:3000.

We hope you enjoy using OurChatStory.co to analyze and gain insights from your WhatsApp chats. Let us know if you have any feedback or suggestions.
